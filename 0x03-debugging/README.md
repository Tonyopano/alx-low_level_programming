Debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (Defects or probelms that prevent correct operation) within computer program,software or system. Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling.

# Debugging

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn how to debug in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-main.c` | Test that function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0` |
| `1-main.c` | Fixed program to the infinite loop |
| `2-largest_number.c` | Prints the largest of three integers |
| `3-print_remaining_days.c` | Converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year |
| `holberton.h` | Header file |
